### Day 2: April 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed all 44 challenges in the "Basic CSS" section at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** As with HTML, this went really quickly. I was pleased to find myself using CSS more readily than I have in the past. I think I've finally wrapped my head around CSS variables now, which I haven't been able to do before.

### Day 1: April 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the first 28 challenges at freeCodeCamp, finishing the "Basic HTML and HTML5" section.

**Thoughts** This went really quickly. There's only so much to worry about with HTML. I know the rest will be more challenging.
