# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Entries are in reverse chronological order.

### Day 13: May 10, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Completed the [Technical Documentation Page Project]() at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Again, it feels good to really get into the code and poke around and problem-solve. I definitely will be digging deeper into CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid, which I feel I'm only beginning to scratch the surface of. (Here's a challenge to myself to use CSS Grid more for the next project.)

### Day 12: May 9, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Completed the [Product Landing Page Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page) at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It felt really good to dig into this and to make the CSS do what I want it to do. Like old times. Took a long time, but I'm very pleased with the result. I'm deliberately designing mobile-first, so as often as possible the media queries are actually for larger screens rather than smaller was.

### Day 11: May 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the [Survey Form Responsive Web Design Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form) at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I still have to refer to reference material more often than I would like for forms, but I think that's because it's so rare for me to need to code my own forms these days.

### Day 10: May 4, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the [Tribute Page Responsive Web Design Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page) at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to really make a thing rather than just do an exercise, even if it's something little like this. And it also feels good to look at the user stories and think, "Oh right. I know how to do that." There were a couple of things I had to go back to some reference materials to remember how to do, but overall I'm very pleased with how I did this.

### Day 4: April 24, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Applied Visual Design challenges at freeCodeCamp and started Applied Accessibility.

**Thoughts** Accessibility is another area I want to dig into more deeply later. It's so important, and I know I haven't done a good job with it in the past.

### Day 3: April 23, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I started the Applied Visual Design challenges at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I definitely am going to dig into CSS for drawing and animation more later. This feels like an area that you can only scratch the surface of in something like this, but where it's valuable to know more.

### Day 2: April 22, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed all 44 challenges in the "Basic CSS" section at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** As with HTML, this went really quickly. I was pleased to find myself using CSS more readily than I have in the past. I think I've finally wrapped my head around CSS variables now, which I haven't been able to do before.

### Day 1: April 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the first 28 challenges at freeCodeCamp, finishing the "Basic HTML and HTML5" section.

**Thoughts** This went really quickly. There's only so much to worry about with HTML. I know the rest will be more challenging.
