# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Entries are in reverse chronological order.

### Day 3: April 23, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I started the Applied Visual Design challenges at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I definitely am going to dig into CSS for drawing and animation more later. This feels like an area that you can only scratch the surface of in something like this, but where it's valuable to know more.

### Day 2: April 22, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed all 44 challenges in the "Basic CSS" section at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** As with HTML, this went really quickly. I was pleased to find myself using CSS more readily than I have in the past. I think I've finally wrapped my head around CSS variables now, which I haven't been able to do before.

### Day 1: April 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the first 28 challenges at freeCodeCamp, finishing the "Basic HTML and HTML5" section.

**Thoughts** This went really quickly. There's only so much to worry about with HTML. I know the rest will be more challenging.
