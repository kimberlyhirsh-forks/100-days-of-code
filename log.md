# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the first 28 challenges at freeCodeCamp, finishing the "Basic HTML and HTML5" section.

**Thoughts** This went really quickly. There's only so much to worry about with HTML. I know the rest will be more challenging.
